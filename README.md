First repository made following GutHub guide

Hi everybody, i'm Andrea (aka Milthares) and i'm 29 years old.
I love videogames, music, and coding and n the last two months I started studying to become a Full Stack Developer.

Kinda trying to find my place in the world, still experimenting with new stuff everyday.
